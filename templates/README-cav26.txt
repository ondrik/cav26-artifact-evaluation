CAV 2026 Artifact
=======================================
Paper title: [PAPER TITLE]

Claimed badges: Available + Functional + Reusable [remove which do not apply; note that Reusable subsumes Functional]

Justification for the badges: [no need to justify Available -- just provide the DOI link in HotCRP]

  * Functional: [give reasons why you believe that the Functional badge should be awarded (if applied for)]
    - replicated: [which claims/results of the paper are replicated by the
      artifact and how (you can, e.g., refer to a concrete point in FULL REVIEW
      below), e.g.,
       * Table 1: point (1)
       * Figure 1: point (2)
       * Figures 2 and 3: point (3)
       * Figure 4: point (4) [requires external connectivity]
       * Proof of Thm. 5: point (5)
      ]
    - not-replicated: [which claims/results cannot be replicated and why, e.g.,
       * Table 2: to reproduce the results, one needs to have access to the
                  computer Holly 6000, which is not available outside our
                  research lab
       * Table 3: this table is a result of a survey among undergraduate students
                  at the Institute of Happiness; the survey cannot be
                  reproduced as a part of the artifact, but the raw filled in
                  questionnaires are available in the directory survey/
       * Fig. 6: to obtain the results, one needs to have a working installation
                 of AcmeVerifier of Acme Inc.; if the reviewers have it,
                 they can reproduce the results by point (6) below.
      ]
  * Reusable: [give reasons why you believe that the Reusable badge should be
    awarded (if applied for)]

Requirements:

  * RAM: [FILL IN]
  * CPU cores: [FILL IN]
  * Time (smoke test): [expected time to execute the smoke test on a standard
    laptop (including compilation, installation, etc.)]
  * Time (full review): [expected time to execute the full review (do not
    include the time of reviewers reading the paper, playing with the tool on
    their own, etc.)]

external connectivity: [NO/YES]

  [If YES, please clarify here what is being accessed and why.  If external
  connectivity is required for some part, please indicate the parts in the
  sections below.  Example:

  Point (4) of the full review needs external connectivity to Acme Inc. due to
  the use of their graph generator.

**                                SMOKE TEST                                 **
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[below is an example of how to write this section; delete it and substitute
with your instructions]

Download the artifact package on the virtual machine into the $HOME directory
and run the following:

  cd artifact/
  ./install.sh

This starts the installation process of Tool, Debian and Python packages, and other tools.

Start the smoke test with

  ./run-smoke.sh results/output-smoke.csv       [ ~ runtime: 10 minutes]

The smoke test runs all tools on the first 10 benchmarks from each data set.
If everything runs successfully, the script should print out intermediate progress, similar to the following:

  ==Executing experiments on data set: Pikachu==
  [1/30] Running Tool on gym1.pok... YES, 0.24345
  [2/30] Running BigCatcher on gym1.pok... YES, 12.3124
  [3/30] Running AshRevived on gym1.pok... -, TIMEOUT
  [4/30] Running Tool on gym2.pok... NO, 1.2344
  ....
  [30/30] Running AshRevived on gym10.pok... NO, 34.3333

  ==Executing experiments on data set: Psyduck==
  [1/30] Running Tool on bear1.pok... -, TIMEOUT
  [2/30] Running BigCatcher on bear1.pok... -, TIMEOUT
  [3/30] Running AshRevived on bear1.pok... NO, 0.3334
  [4/30] Running Tool on bear2.pok... YES, 0.4322
  ....
  [30/30] Running AshRevived on bear10.pok... NO, 4.2345

  ==EXPERIMENTS FINISHED==

(1) To check that Table 1 generation works, run the following command:

    cd results/
    ./generate_table1.sh output-smoke.csv

    and the output table should looks like this (with possible different mean
    and median values):

    Name           Pikachu mean     Pikachu median     Pikachu TO     Psyduck mean     Psyduck median     Psyduck TO
    ----------  ---------------  -----------------  -------------  ---------------  -----------------  -------------
    Tool                 0.3454             0.1233              2           0.5666             0.8923              1
    BigCatcher          12.343              9.983               5          45.3434            45.3434              9
    AshRevived           7.343             34.344               2         324.33             344.34                2

(2) To check that Figure 1 generation works, run the following command:

    cd results/
    ./generate_fig1.sh output-smoke.csv

    the figure will then be in results/fig1.svg; there should be 8 blue
    triangle points and 2 red circle points.

(3) To check that Figures 2 and 3 generation works, run the following command:

    cd results/
    ./generate_figs2_3.sh output.csv

    the figures will then be in results/fig2.png (it should contain one red and
    one blue line) and results/fig3.pdf (it should contain a pie chart with 3
    segments).

(4) To check that certification of the proof of Thm. 5. works, run

    rocqc thm5_proof_short.v
    echo "exit code = $?"

    The exit code should be 0.

For completeness, we included the output files obtained by our experiments in
folder ref_output_smoke/.

If the results are not as described above, please check the file
$HOME/artifact/smoke.log and try to identify something extraordinary (e.g. by
comparing it to the file ref_output_smoke/smoke.log.ref).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming the smoke test passed, run the following command to reproduce the
results.  Running the full benchmark suite can take around 1 week on a standard
laptop, so we also provide a short version containing a selection of benchmarks
that should show the same trends as the whole suite and finishes in ~4 hours.

  cd results/

  ./run_full.sh results/output.csv     [to run the full version ~ runtime: 1 week]

or 

  ./run_short.sh results/output.csv    [to run the short version ~ runtime: 4 hours]

The commands will print out progress as their execute the benchmarks.
The output will be a file "output.csv".

For completeness, we included the output files obtained by our experiments in
folder ref_output_full/.

(1) To obtain the results in Table 1, run the following command:

    cd results/
    ./generate_table1.sh output.csv

    and the table will be printed on the standard output

(2) To obtain the results in Figure 1, run the following command:

    cd results/
    ./generate_fig1.sh output.csv

    the figure will then be in results/fig1.svg

(3) To generate Figures 2 and 3, run the following command:

    cd results/
    ./generate_figs2_3.sh output.csv

    the figure will then be in results/fig2.png and results/fig3.pdf

(4) [this point requires external connectivity]
    To generate Figure 4, run

    cd results/
    ./generate_fig4.sh survey/data.xml

    this will access the servers of Acme Inc. to generate the figure, which will be in results/fig4.svg

(5) To certify the proof of Thm. 5., run

    rocqc thm5_proof.v
    echo "exit code = $?"

    if exit code is 0, the proof is verified

(6) [optional, this step needs a working copy of AcmeVerifier; expected runtime: 1 hour]
    To generate Figure 6, run the following command
    
    # set up a working copy of AcmeVerifier on the virtual machine
    export ACME_VER_PATH=<path to the AcmeVerifier binary>
    export ACME_VER_LICENSE_KEY=<AcmeVerifier license key>
    ./run_acme.sh output_acme.csv
    ./generate_fig5.sh output_acme.csv

    the resulting figure will be in results/fig5.gif
